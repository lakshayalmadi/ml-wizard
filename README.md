# ML-Wizard

## About
This extension automatically loads the required initial code for importing libraries and data preprocessing and gives a template for basic classification and regression algorithms.

This extension also adds a button to the toolbar allowing you to insert the ml-preset-files cell above your current cell. Pressing the buttons will add the libraries and commented-out code for creating an ML model.


## Requirements
If you don't have jupyter notebook extensions added you have to run the command:

`pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions && jupyter contrib nbextensions install`


You will see a nbextension tab being added to jupyter notebook.

Then just open up a new notebook and enable the extension in the nbextensions tab.
