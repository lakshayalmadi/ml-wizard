# ML-Wizard

## About
This extension automatically loads the required initial code for importing libraries and data preprocessing and gives a template for basic classification and regression algorithms.

## Requirements
If you don't have jupyter notebook extensions added you have to run the command:
<br>
`pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions && jupyter contrib nbextensions install`


You will see a nbextension tab being added to jupyter notebook.
